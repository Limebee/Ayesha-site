# How It's Made:
<strong>Tech used:</strong> HTML, CSS, Javascript

I first focused on the structure for the site. I decided how I wanted to oraganize each section. I created a section for each part of the website. I started with the intro. Using HTML, I input the logo for the site as well as the photo. The button was created as well which leads to the about us section when clicked.
