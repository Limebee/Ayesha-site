# How It's Made:
<strong>Tech used:</strong> HTML, CSS, Javascript

I first focused on the structure of the site. I decided how I wanted to organize each section. I created sectioned each part of the website and labeled each. Using HTML, I input the logo for the site and the photo. The button leads to the about us section when clicked. I changed the button color and rounded the corners of it using CSS. I also added the images for each. I also created a list of services for the salon. I organized each type of service into sections and set the border's color and weight. For each stylist, I included their name and bio on the left. I added their picture on the right. For the salon hours, I created a table.
# Lessons Learned
This project helped me to refine my HTML and CSS skills.
