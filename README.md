# Ayesha-site
Ayesha is a responsive website made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It's a website that features a salon. It allows users view information about the salon. 
They can look at the salon services as well as learn more about the stylists. In the future I would like to add a system where users can book a an appointment on the website. They can log in to manage their appointments.
